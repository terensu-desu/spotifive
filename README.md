# Spotifive

One night (or morning), George R. R. Martin imagined the scene of Bran, Robb, and Jon finding the five direwolves in the snow. This scene sparked the creation of the great 'A Song of Ice and Fire' book series which the TV show 'Game of Thrones' is loosely based on.

Much like that great book series, Spotifive came to me one evening while I attempted to get some sleep. I immediately got up and jotted down my ideas to pick up on them later. This hit me while I was in Japan still learning React and web development in general, dreaming of breaking into the industry on my self-taughtness. Now I'm all grown, that dream was realized, and I've returned to finish this idea.

## Deets

Spotifive is gonna let you authenticate with through Spotify's API, return you to the app, and allow you to select your top artists or tracks. Once you've done that, you can choose your collage style and generate it. Spotifive uses the Cloudinary API to make collages. If you're satisfied with the results, you can share it!

### Shameless plug

Actually I don't have one. Maybe I'll throw my flickr on here.
